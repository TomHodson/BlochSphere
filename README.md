# BlochSphere

View the web application [here](http://smarsh.me/BlochSphere/bloch.html).

This is a WebGL animation of the evolution of the Bloch vector of a two-level quantum system under the influence of oscillating light field. Supports arbitrary Rabi frequency and detuning. You can move the viewpoint by dragging, and scroll to zoom in/out. 

Currently half-done - will refactor this to support light-pulses of fixed duration (e.g. pi/2 pulse).
